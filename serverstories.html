<h2> Kobe Bryant > My Job </h2>
<h3> Written by: Beatriz Sevilla</h3>
  <p>
    My job is located next door to Larry's Cheesesteaks, famously known as Kobe Bryant's
    favorite stop in Philly. KObe has been my idol since I was little and is who I consider
    the greatest basketball player ever to live. I was working one night when a customer at my
    bartop told me he was there. laughed thinking she was joking, but she showed me a picture. I immediatly told
    the other bartender I had to go see him and I ran out. I was gone for 20 minutes, leaving the
    empty bar in the capable hands of another bar tender. When I came back, she was complaining to the
    manager about hwo I left. I explained that yes, I shouldn't have left but I wasn't going
    to lose the opportunity to meet my idol. Long story short, my manaher sent me home early and
    I met Kobe. Win, win.
